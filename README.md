# KennethsChatRoom
An ongoing project to demonstrate my SCSS, React, html and node abilities.

Brief description of what is being done:
- Using React as the front end of my website
- Using SCSS and BootStrap to style React frontend and make it responsive
- Using node.js as a backend to redirect requets and general API calls
- MongoDB cluster to save information on users, messages
- Using socket.io to allow real-time chat messages
- Using redux-react for username and chat room identification
- BCrypt for encryption of password
- More socket.io for real-time refresh of friends status
- Real time friend adding, friend request

What will be implemented next:
- Scaling and deploying to the web (will look into NginX, Apache Tomcat, Heroku, AWS, Azure... all that backend stuff)
