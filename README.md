# KennethsChatRoom
An ongoing project to demonstrate my SCSS, React, html and node abilities.

Brief description of what is being done:
- Using React as the front end of my website
- Using SCSS to style React frontend
- Using node.js as a backend to redirect requets
- MongoDB cluster to save information on users, messages
- Using socket.io to allow real-time chat messages

What will be implemented next:
- I will start with simple jwt authentication and then move on to oauth to secure my website.
- Then I will work on making multiple "rooms" so users can switch between chat rooms.
